## 📖 Project Overview

**UnifiedPay treats all USDC across chains as one unified liquidity surface.**

UnifiedPay enables creators to accept USDC payments on **Arc Network** as the primary settlement layer, while giving users visibility into their **unified USDC balance across 15+ chains** via **Circle Gateway**. Payments are made to human-readable **ENS names** (`creator.eth`) instead of hex addresses, with dynamic ENS resolution at runtime.

The result: **A non-custodial payment experience where users pay on Arc, creators receive on Arc, and the complexity of multi-chain USDC management is abstracted away.**

### The Problem

Traditional Web3 payment platforms fragment liquidity across chains. A creator might accept payments on Ethereum, Polygon, and Base — but this creates:
- **Fragmented balances** that require manual reconciliation
- **Poor UX** — users must switch chains or bridge assets
- **Hex address fatigue** — sharing `0x1234...` instead of human names

### The Solution

UnifiedPay uses:
1. **Arc Network** as the single settlement and coordination layer
2. **Circle Gateway** for unified USDC balance visibility across 15+ chains
3. **ENS** for human-readable payment identities

Users see their total USDC across all chains, pay on Arc, and creators receive instantly on Arc — all without bridging, swapping, or managing multiple chain UIs.

---

## 🌐 Why Arc Network?

**Arc serves as the coordination and settlement layer for UnifiedPay.**

While users may hold USDC on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, or other chains (visible via Circle Gateway), **all payments settle on Arc**. This design:

- ✅ **Avoids fragmenting liquidity** — One settlement layer, not N chains
- ✅ **Provides fast, low-cost settlement** — Creators receive payments instantly
- ✅ **Uses Arc as single source of truth** — Payment state lives on Arc
- ✅ **Eliminates bridge UX** — No manual chain switching or asset transfers

Arc is not just "another chain" — it's the **unified settlement surface** for cross-chain USDC liquidity.

### Arc's Role in the Payment Flow

```
1. User sees unified USDC balance (via Circle Gateway)
2. User pays with USDC on Arc Network
3. Payment settles on Arc (coordination layer)
4. Creator receives USDC on Arc (single chain, instant)
```

By using Arc as the settlement layer, UnifiedPay demonstrates how **multiple chains can share one liquidity surface** without fragmenting user experience.

## 💰 Circle Gateway Integration

**Circle Gateway provides unified USDC balance visibility.**

UnifiedPay integrates Circle Gateway's **balance aggregation API** to show users their total USDC across **15+ chains** in one unified view:

- Ethereum
- Base
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Polygon
- Avalanche
- Solana
- Unichain
- Sonic
- World Chain
- HyperEVM
- Sei
- **Arc Network**
- ...and more

### What Circle Gateway Does (and Doesn't Do)

✅ **What it does:**
- Aggregates USDC balances across all chains into one unified number
- Provides real-time balance visibility via Circle's API
- Helps users answer: *"Do I have enough USDC across my wallets to make this payment?"*

❌ **What it doesn't do:**
- Does NOT automatically bridge or swap assets
- Does NOT custody user funds
- Does NOT execute cross-chain transfers

**This is balance reconciliation, not bridging.** Users see their total USDC liquidity surface, then pay with USDC on Arc.

### Implementation Details

- Uses Circle Gateway REST API (`/v1/balances`)
- Read-only integration (no write operations)
- Falls back to direct RPC queries if Circle Gateway is unavailable
- Supports both testnet and mainnet environments

## 🔗 ENS Integration

**ENS provides human-readable payment identities.**

Instead of sharing payment links like `unifiedpay.com/pay/0x1234...`, creators can use **ENS names** like:

```
unifiedpay.com/pay/creator.eth ✓
```

### What UnifiedPay Implements

✅ **Runtime ENS resolution** (forward and reverse)
- Forward: `creator.eth` → `0x1234...`
- Reverse: `0x1234...` → `creator.eth`

✅ **ENS avatar display** from on-chain records
- Fetches and displays ENS avatars via `resolver.getAvatar()`

✅ **Dynamic lookups** — No hardcoded addresses
- All ENS resolution happens at runtime via ethers.js ENS API
- Uses Ethereum Sepolia testnet for ENS lookups

### Why This Matters

ENS is not cosmetic — it's the **identity layer** for payments:
- **Better UX**: Share `creator.eth` instead of `0x1234...`
- **On-chain verification**: ENS names resolve to addresses trustlessly
- **Portable identity**: ENS names work across all chains

### Implementation Details

- Uses ethers.js `provider.resolveName()` and `provider.lookupAddress()`
- Implements 5-minute in-memory cache for performance
- Gracefully falls back to hex addresses if ENS resolution fails
- Supports ENS avatars from IPFS, HTTP, and data URIs

Code reference: `lib/ens.ts`

## 🏗️ Integration Highlights

### Arc Network Integration ✓

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Uses Arc as coordination layer** | All payments settle on Arc; Arc is the single source of truth for payment state |
| **Demonstrates multi-chain UX** | Circle Gateway shows balances across 15+ chains; users pay on Arc without chain switching |
| **Shows Arc's unique value** | Arc enables "one liquidity surface" by serving as the settlement layer for cross-chain USDC |
| **Technical implementation** | Direct Arc Network integration via RPC; USDC transfers on Arc; payment recording on Arc |

**Why this matters for Arc**: UnifiedPay demonstrates how Arc can serve as a **coordination layer** that unifies fragmented multi-chain liquidity into one settlement surface.

---

### ENS Integration ✓

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Runtime ENS resolution** | Uses ethers.js `resolveName()` and `lookupAddress()` — no hardcoded addresses |
| **Human-readable identities** | Payment URLs use ENS names (`/pay/creator.eth`) instead of hex addresses |
| **ENS avatar integration** | Displays ENS avatars from on-chain records via `resolver.getAvatar()` |
| **Forward + reverse lookup** | Resolves ENS names to addresses AND addresses to ENS names |
| **Dynamic, not static** | All ENS data fetched at runtime; 5-minute cache for performance |

**Why this matters for ENS**: UnifiedPay treats ENS as the **identity layer** for Web3 payments, making payment URLs human-readable and verifiable on-chain.
